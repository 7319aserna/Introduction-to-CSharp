I think cobblestone is a great block and always I use it in my builds, sometimes with it as the main block. I just think it has a great texture, and it’s easy to get in huge quantities which is nice. Granted, it doesn’t look good to have a build made entirely of cobble - however, this goes for any block in the game. Cobble is basically the best all-around block that the game has to offer. Thanks for listening");
