# Introduction to C#

Introduction to C# was a project created at the [Academy of Interactive Entertainment](https://seattle.aie.edu/campuses/seattle/). This project was a way to introduce us into C# and helped us understand the differences between C# and C++ and was a way to practice. Another purpose of this project was to help us learn what we needed, before we began using the Unity game engine. The assessment for this subject was to use what we learned, to create a WPF application.
